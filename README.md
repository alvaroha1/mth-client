## Motivation
We realized there are multiple entry barriers to operate in the real-estate market. One of them is the existence of several data sources.
With MTH we wanted to create a platform to aggregate all the data and provide a layer of data analysis over the different opportunities.
Our client features a filter, a map and different metrics to help the user in their purchase decision.

## Tech Stack
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - Front end library for building user interfaces
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - Bulma is an open source CSS framework based on Flexbox.
* [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) - Mapbox is a Live Location Platform used for the map.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icons library. Used for the icons.
